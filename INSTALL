  This program requires giflib, which can be acquired at 
www.ccil.org/~esr/giflib/.  Be certain that you do not install a broken
version of the library that has all of the encode functions disabled,
such as those that come in GNOME RPMs.  

  To install, just run './configure', followed by 'make', and then 
'make install' if all goes well.  The binaries of course may be installed 
manually in other directories after a build.
