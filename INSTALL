This program requires either giflib or pnglib to do anything useful.

Giflib can be obtained at http://www.ccil.org/~esr/giflib/.  Be certain 
that you do not install a broken version of the library that has all of 
the encode functions disabled, such as ungiflib.  I leave it up to you
to work out the moral dilemmas associated with using a format covered
by patents.  Libpng is open, ubiquitous and should be on most Unix 
systems. 

  To build, just run:

     $ ./configure
     $ make 

  This distribution is not expected to be worthwhile enough to put much
effort into the configuration end, so no promises are made about ease of 
porting or code fitness.  I have, however, had few problems on the three
platforms I've tried: Intel Linux, Cygwin, and Sparc Solaris (so at least
the endian problem is covered).
