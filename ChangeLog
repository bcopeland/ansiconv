-- Revision History --
-- Revision 1.3

  Added thumbnailing.  

-- Revision 1.2

  I went through a lot of trouble to automate this stuff with GNU 
  automake & autoconf.  
  As a side effect, ansiconv-1.2 is now GPLed! 
  Added code to generate idfview.cgi, the IDF equivalent of ansiview.cgi.
  Ditto for binview.cgi, except for BINs.
  Both operate the same as the other executable.

-- Revision 1.1

  Command line and cgi based viewing are now in single executable.
  Made a few changes to code structure to make it easier to add features.
  Dropped memory usage drastically by not allocating the entire pixmap.
   
-- Revision 1.0

  Original version.  It works.
