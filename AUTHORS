   The ansiconv suite of ansi conversion utilities comes from the hard
work of the following dedicated persons:

   o Bob Copeland <me@bobcopeland.com> - Wrote the original code.

   o Other people have given suggestions and donated code: 

     - Vertigo/Dementia recommended modifying the colormaps
     - Slothy suggested smarter CGI detection
     - Neophyte pointed out the above CGI detection was broken
     - MrMr generally provided a testbed for my code by using it
       in an application and found a couple bugs early on.
     - Lord Scarlet has used this in production and keeps finding
       broken stuff.
