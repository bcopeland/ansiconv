   The ansiconv suite of ansi conversion utilities comes from the hard
work of the following dedicated persons:

   o Bob Copeland <bobc@ieee.org> - Wrote all of the code.

   o Other people gave me small, insignificant, worthless suggestions 
     (such as "fix this resource leak").  For the most part I listened.
