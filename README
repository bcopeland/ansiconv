Ansiconv v. 1.8.

This program parses an ansi and makes a gif out of it, and displays it for 
all to see.  Pretty swell, huh?

COPYING file for details.

Read INSTALL for installation instructions.

Some useful features:

  o Outputs only a few lines of text at a time so has a fairly small
    memory footprint (currently, significant memory usage is 
    168 * lines of ansi + 51200).

  o Can be used from command line to generate images to files or pipes.
  
  o Can be used from webserver to serve out images

  o IDF and BIN file converters.  When ANSI just isn't enough.

  o Thumbnails for quick & easy viewing
