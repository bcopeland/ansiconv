Ansiconv v. 2.1

This program parses an ansi and makes an image out of it, and displays it for 
all to see.  Pretty swell, huh?

This code is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.  See 
the COPYING file for details.

Read INSTALL for installation and usage instructions.

Some useful features:

  o Outputs only a few lines of text at a time so has a fairly small
    memory footprint (currently, significant memory usage is 
    168 * lines of ansi + 51200).

  o Can be used from command line to generate images to files or pipes.
  
  o IDF and BIN file converters.  When ANSI just isn't enough.

  o Thumbnails for quick & easy viewing

  o PHP module interface for use from a CGI
