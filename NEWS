New in this version:

  * Added configure option for using a different palette.  
    Several people have noted that the colors look wrong.
    I took them from the _Programmer's Guide To EGA/VGA Cards_ 
    where they are defined as 6-bit components (as in the VGA
    registers) and scaled them linearly to 8-bit components.
    So either I messed up the math, should have scaled in
    some other color space, or the VGA DACs operate 
    differently in text and high-resolution modes.  I haven't
    decided which.  At any rate, until I get a chance to look
    over it once more, you can supply the --enable-altcolors 
    switch to ``configure'' to use a colormap that was graciously 
    supplied by Vertigo.
     
  * Fixed a problem with the CLI and CGI invocation selection.
    I had a conditional backwards.  Thanks to Neophyte for 
    pointing that out.

  * Fixed configure scripts so that libgif is not required.

  * There was a memory leak -- none of the binary lists were
    destroyed.
